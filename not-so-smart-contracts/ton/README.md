# (Not So) Smart Contracts

This repository contains examples of common TON smart contract vulnerabilities, featuring code from real smart contracts. Utilize the Not So Smart Contracts to learn about TON vulnerabilities, refer to them during security reviews, and use them as a benchmark for security analysis tools.

## Features

Each _Not So Smart Contract_ consists of a standard set of information:

- Vulnerability type description
- Attack scenarios to exploit the vulnerability
- Recommendations to eliminate or mitigate the vulnerability
- Real-world contracts exhibiting the flaw
- References to third-party resources providing more information

## Vulnerabilities
